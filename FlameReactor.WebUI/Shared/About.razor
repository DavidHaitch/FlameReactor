            Each flame is composed of multiple mathematical steps layered on top of each other. This layering process allows for incredible variation, especially in motion.

            The Flame Reactor allows you to breed fractal flames together with a genetic algorithm. It then animates the flame, taking it through a full rotation.
            The resulting flame is then bred with the next choice, and so on.
            In this way, we cooperatively create a slowly-mutating lineage.
